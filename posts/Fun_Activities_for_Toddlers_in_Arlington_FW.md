**Kimbell Art Museum**: Children’s Play Room. **Cost**: the whole museum is free. **Hours**: T-Th 10-5, Fr 12-8, Sat 10-5, Sun 12-5. Located in the back building, ask a worker and they will show you the way. The website says for ages 5 and younger. There are a ton of sensory activities and books available. The outdoor parking is a bit of a walk away but there is underground parking available. I have not used the underground parking yet because I feel safer being outside when I’m alone getting the boys in and out of the car.  

**Fort Worth Museum of Science and History.** **Cost**: Adults-$16, Juniors-$13, under 2- free. **Hours**: T-Sat 10-5, Sun 12-5. If you buy tickets, it’s worth it to spend the whole day there. For Christmas, I asked for a membership and the boys will get memberships when they turn 2. We like to come and go quickly (there are messy play opportunities- both outside) and with a membership, it’s not a waste of money if you go at least 5 times a year. 

**The Stockyards Museum.** **Cost**: $2, 12 and under are free. **Hours**: M-Sat 10-5pm. “There is a growing collection of artifacts, photos and exhibits that document everything from our Native American connections, the Chisholm Trail, and the livestock market/stockyards.” 

**Fort Worth Aviation Museum.** **Cost**: family of up to 6- $15, Adults- $7, youth-$2, 6 and under- free. **Hours**: W 9-4pm, Sat 9-5pm, Sun 11-5pm. I’m so excited to take my boys here eventually! This museum has over 20 historical planes to check out.  

**National Cowgirl Museum and Hall of Fame.** **Cost**: Adults- $5, 4-12 years- $3.50, 3 and under- free. **Hours**: Tues-Sat 10-5pm, Sun 12-5pm. This museum is on my personal bucket list but I plan on bringing my boys along! 

 

 

 

##Play spaces{:.section} 

**Celebrations Fort Worth.** **Cost**: Adults-free, 1 and younger-free, kids-$8. **Hours**: T and Th 10-2pm. I found out about this place through Groupon (a good place to check for a discount if you plan on going more than once) and my boys LOVED it. They have a ton of riding cars, toys, a bounce house, and more. The site lists that they have air hockey, basketball, and foosball for older children.  

**Flight Deck Arlington and Fort Worth- Toddler Tumble (6 and under).** **Cost**: $8 with free entrance for one adult. **Hours**: W and F 10-12pm. We’ve been one time so far and we practically had the whole place to ourselves!  

**Urban Air Arlington- Jumperoo (5 and under).** **Cost**: $8 a child, one parent for free. **Hours**: Most Fridays from 10-12pm. They also hold ‘Sensory Friendly Sundays,’ an event specifically designed for children with Autism and special needs. This is held every Sunday from 10-12pm and is $8 per person. 

**Pump It Up Arlington and Fort Worth- Ages 5 and Under.** **Cost**: Adults- free, 1 and younger-free, kids- $6.50. **Hours**: M W and F 10-12pm. The website says children over 5 will not be admitted during this time. It looks like the calendar on the website is updated weekly, and sometimes the time changes to 10:45-12:15, so I would call ahead and make sure the time is correct!  

**Playstreet- Irving (Fort Worth coming soon).** **Cost**: $11.50 each child ages 1-8. **Hours**: M-F 9-5pm. 

**Play Studio by Green Space- Fort Worth.** **Cost**: $12 per child or $100 for a 10-Play Pass. **Hours**: T,W & Th 9-5pm, F & Sat 9-2pm. This place seems really cute and they hold classes and events, such as, ‘You Work We Play’ for $25.

I think the prices are great, and there is plenty to do, but this place is HUGE. I don’t plan on letting my boys (2 years) play here until they are older because it doesn’t look like they have a designated toddler time.  

**Recess Time Indoor Playground Toddler Time- Burleson.** **Cost**: $8 for children over 1 year old, children under 1 year old are free with a paid child. **Hours**: M and Th 10-12pm. Regular open play hours are 12-7pm daily.

We have not been here yet but it looks like a great place to promote gross motor skills. If you look up reviews, customers have posted photos, and it looks like there is a lot to climb on!

##Other ideas{:.section} 

**Chick Fil A.** I will literally take my kids in there just to play and then use the drive thru to get food after we’re done to save the hassle of eating there.  

**Splash Pads.** Clayton Chandler Park- Mansfield, Howard Moore Park- Arlington, Don Misenhimer- Arlington are a few good spots.    

**Local library- story time.** Most libraries have story time at least once a week.
